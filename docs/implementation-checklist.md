## üîÑ Next UX Update: Variant Card ‚Üí Detail Page (Plan)

### Problem Analysis

Based on the user feedback and screenshot:

- ‚úÖ **Issue Identified**: "Generate Posts" button moves up when extracted text is short, making it harder to reach with thumb
- ‚úÖ **UX Goal**: Button should remain at bottom for easy thumb access (iOS ergonomics best practice)
- ‚úÖ **Adaptive Behavior**: Text editor should intelligently resize based on context and user interaction

### Detailed Requirements (Completed)

- Pinned Generate button at bottom ‚úÖ
- Editor scrollable when needed ‚úÖ
- Editor auto-minimize after generation ‚úÖ
- Seamless scroll between editor and variants ‚úÖ
- Focus-aware sizing (expand when editing, minimize when viewing variants) ‚úÖ

### Technical Implementation Summary (Completed)

- GeometryReader + VStack for pinned bottom actions ‚úÖ
- Dynamic height state (`textEditorHeight`) and transitions ‚úÖ
- ScrollViewReader auto-scroll to variants ‚úÖ
- Safe-area-aware button positioning ‚úÖ

1. Text editor takes available space minus button area
2. Text content scrollable within editor
3. Generate Posts button remains at bottom

**Scenario C: Post-Generation (Any Text Length)**

1. Text editor minimizes automatically to show variants
2. Variants appear in scrollable middle section
3. User can scroll to see all variants
4. Button remains at bottom throughout

**Scenario D: Editing After Generation**

1. User scrolls to top and taps text editor
2. Text editor expands for comfortable editing
3. Variants hidden/minimized during editing
4. User finishes editing ‚Üí auto-minimize again

### Success Criteria
