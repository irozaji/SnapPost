# SnapPost Implementation Checklist

## Project Overview

Building a native iOS app for **personal productivity** that captures images of book pages, runs OCR to extract text, generates LinkedIn-ready posts with AI, and shares via iOS share sheet.

**v1 Scope:**

- **Personal productivity app** - designed for individual use
- **Direct OpenAI API integration** - no backend required
- **No user accounts or subscriptions** - single-user app
- **No LinkedIn API usage** - share sheet only
- All user data remains on device

**v2+ Future Plans:**

- User accounts and subscription management
- Backend infrastructure for multi-user support
- Usage analytics and billing

**Target**: iOS 17+, SwiftUI, No backend in v1

**üìä OpenAI Response Data Structure Specification:**

**Expected JSON Response Format:**

```json
[
  {
    "tone": "punchy",
    "text": "üöÄ This insight completely changed my perspective on leadership..."
  },
  {
    "tone": "contrarian",
    "text": "Unpopular opinion: What if everything we know about..."
  },
  {
    "tone": "personal",
    "text": "This passage hit me hard. It reminded me of my own journey..."
  },
  {
    "tone": "analytical",
    "text": "Breaking down this concept: 3 key factors emerge..."
  },
  {
    "tone": "openQuestion",
    "text": "Fascinating perspective that raises so many questions..."
  }
]
```

**Data Validation Rules:**

- [ ] **Tone Values**: Must exactly match: `punchy`, `contrarian`, `personal`, `analytical`, `openQuestion`
- [ ] **Text Length**: Each post must be ‚â§900 characters (LinkedIn limit)
- [ ] **Content Structure**: Hook line + 1-2 supporting lines + engaging question
- [ ] **Response Count**: Exactly 5 variants (one per tone)
- [ ] **JSON Format**: Valid JSON array with consistent structure
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback for malformed responses

**üîÑ Data Flow & Parsing:**

- [ ] **OpenAI Response**: Raw JSON string in `choices[0].message.content`
- [ ] **JSON Parsing**: Parse content string to `[VariantResponse]` array
- [ ] **Tone Mapping**: Convert string tones to `Tone` enum values
- [ ] **Length Validation**: Check and truncate posts >900 characters
- [ ] **Final Output**: Convert to `[Variant]` array for UI display
- [ ] **Error Recovery**: Handle parsing failures gracefully with user feedback
