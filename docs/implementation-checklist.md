## Planned UI Update: Scanner Results Simplification (‚úÖ COMPLETED)

## Planned UI Update: Navigation & Layout Restructuring (Pending Review)

**Scope**

- Restructure the app to have clear, intuitive navigation between states
- Eliminate confusing duplicate buttons and unclear navigation paths
- Create a proper screen hierarchy with clear user flows
- Implement iOS-standard navigation patterns

**UX Problems Identified**

1. **Confusing duplicate buttons**: "Scan Text" and "Scan New Text" both do the same thing
2. **No way to return home**: Once text is extracted, users are "trapped" in the results view
3. **Unclear navigation flow**: The relationship between scanning, editing, and returning home isn't intuitive
4. **Poor button hierarchy**: No clear distinction between primary actions and navigation actions

**Proposed Solution: Navigation Stack Architecture**

**Screen Structure:**

1. **Home Screen** - Clean, focused design with single "Scan Text" action
2. **Scanner Screen** - Camera/photo picker with preview and confirmation
3. **Results Screen** - Editable extracted text with clear action buttons
4. **Generated Posts Sheet** - Modal presentation of AI-generated variants

**User Flows:**

- **Flow 1**: Home ‚Üí Scan ‚Üí Results ‚Üí Copy ‚Üí Back to Home
- **Flow 2**: Home ‚Üí Scan ‚Üí Results ‚Üí Generate Posts ‚Üí View Variants ‚Üí Share/Copy ‚Üí Back to Home
- **Flow 3**: Home ‚Üí Scan ‚Üí Results ‚Üí Scan New Image ‚Üí New Results

**Button Hierarchy & Layout:**

**Home Screen:**

- Single, prominent "Scan Text" button (primary action)
- Clean, app-like design with no extracted text clutter

**Results Screen:**

- **Top section**: Editable extracted text (full height TextEditor)
- **Bottom section**: Action buttons in logical groups
  - **Primary actions** (high visual weight): Copy, Generate Posts
  - **Navigation actions** (medium visual weight): Scan New Image, Back to Home
- **Clear visual separation** between action and navigation buttons

**Navigation Patterns:**

- **iOS standard navigation bar** with back button and clear titles
- **Always provide escape** - users should never feel trapped
- **Clear purpose** for each button
- **Consistent placement** across screens
- **Logical flow** that matches user mental models

**Key UX Decisions:**

1. **Navigation Style**: iOS standard navigation stack (not modal)

   - **Rationale**: Familiar pattern, clear back navigation, natural flow
   - **Implementation**: Standard navigation bar with back button, clear titles

2. **Button Hierarchy**: Most intuitive button hierarchy

   - **Primary Actions**: Copy, Generate Posts (high visual weight, prominent placement)
   - **Secondary Actions**: Scan New Image, Back to Home (medium visual weight, grouped together)
   - **Visual Distinction**: Use iOS button styles (filled vs outlined) to show hierarchy

3. **Screen Transitions**: Navigation stack approach
   - **Flow**: Home ‚Üí Scanner ‚Üí Results ‚Üí Generated Posts (sheet)
   - **Pros**: Familiar iOS pattern, clear back navigation, natural flow
   - **Cons**: More complex state management
   - **Best for**: Users who expect standard app navigation

**HIG-aligned Bottom-first Layout (‚úÖ COMPLETED)**

- Home
  - Bottom Action Bar pinned to safe area:
    - Primary: ‚ÄúScan Text‚Äù (filled, full-width)
    - Secondary: ‚ÄúChoose from Library‚Äù (outline, full-width)
  - Optional brief helper text above the bar; no large header/branding.
- Scanner entry
  - Preferred: Tap ‚ÄúScan Text‚Äù opens Camera immediately (no choice screen).
  - Alternative: If source choice is needed, present as a bottom sheet with stacked buttons (Take Photo, Choose from Library), Cancel at bottom.
- Results
  - Content: full-height editable `TextEditor`.
  - Bottom Action Bar pinned to safe area:
    - Primary: ‚ÄúGenerate Posts‚Äù (filled, full-width)
    - Secondary: ‚ÄúCopy‚Äù (outline, full-width)
  - Tertiary: ‚ÄúScan New‚Äù as a link beneath the bar; top-left Back returns to Home.
- Generated Posts
  - Present as a bottom sheet (medium detent; expandable). Dismiss with swipe or ‚ÄúDone‚Äù.
  - Variant cards with Copy/Share per card.
- Transitions
  - Home ‚Üí Camera/Library: system pickers; return to Results.
  - Results ‚Üí Generated Posts: bottom sheet.
  - Back: nav bar back to Home; swipe-down to dismiss sheet.

**Acceptance Criteria (Bottom-first)** ‚úÖ COMPLETED

- [x] All primary CTAs are bottom-aligned and within safe area.
- [x] Home presents camera directly; source selection (if used) appears as a bottom sheet.
- [x] Results shows "Generate Posts" (primary) and "Copy" (secondary) at the bottom.
- [x] Clear escape paths: Back from Results; swipe-down from Generated Posts.
- [x] Buttons meet 44pt min height and adequate spacing; dynamic type and contrast respected.

**Implementation Plan**

1. **Restructure ContentView** to use proper navigation stack
2. **Create distinct screen states** with clear navigation between them
3. **Implement proper button hierarchy** with visual distinction
4. **Add navigation bar** with back buttons and clear titles
5. **Eliminate duplicate buttons** and confusing navigation paths
6. **Test user flows** to ensure intuitive navigation

**Acceptance Criteria**

- [ ] Clear navigation between Home, Scanner, and Results screens
- [ ] No duplicate or confusing buttons
- [ ] Always provide a way to return home or navigate away
- [ ] Proper button hierarchy with visual distinction
- [ ] iOS-standard navigation patterns
- [ ] Intuitive user flows for all use cases
- [ ] No "trapped" states where users can't navigate away

**Files to Modify**

- `SnapPost/ContentView.swift` - Complete restructuring for navigation stack
- Navigation state management and screen transitions
- Button hierarchy and visual design
- User flow implementation

**Scope**

- Remove the "Captured just now" timestamp label from the results view
- Rename "Copy Text" to "Copy" and add a clear copied state with haptics
- Make the extracted text container take nearly full screen height for comfortable reading
- Remove the dedicated Compose Post view; keep generation inline from the results screen
- After extraction, provide only two primary actions: "Copy" and "Generate Posts"

**Execution Plan**

1. Results Screen UX adjustments (in `SnapPost/ContentView.swift`) ‚úÖ COMPLETED

   - [x] Remove timestamp/"Captured just now" label and any related time-ago helpers
   - [x] Make extracted text editable in place
     - [x] Replace read-only text with `TextEditor` bound to local state initialized from OCR result
     - [x] Ensure edits are preserved while view is active and used by actions
   - [x] Make text container fill available vertical space:
     - [x] Use layout that expands (e.g., `ScrollView` with `frame(maxHeight: .infinity, alignment: .top)` within a flexible container)
     - [x] Ensure safe-area padding and comfortable line spacing
   - [x] Replace "Copy Text" with "Copy" button
     - [x] Copy to clipboard using `UIPasteboard` (use the edited text)
     - [x] Add copied state (label changes to "Copied" for ~1.5s, then reverts)
     - [x] Provide light haptic feedback on success and accessibility announcements
   - [x] Primary actions: show only two buttons ‚Äî "Copy" and "Generate Posts"
     - [x] Arrange with consistent spacing, min tappable area, and margins

2. Remove Composer view flow ‚úÖ COMPLETED

   - [x] Remove navigation/sheet trigger to `ComposerView`
   - [x] Inline generation entry point from results screen via "Generate Posts"
   - [x] De-register `ComposerView.swift` and `ComposeVM.swift` from the build
   - [x] Update project file references (no dead files in target)

3. Inline Generate Posts flow (no dedicated Composer screen) ‚úÖ COMPLETED

   - [x] On tap "Generate Posts": start generation with existing `AIClient` using the current edited text
   - [x] Show progress indicator while generating
   - [x] Present results inline (e.g., bottom sheet or expandable section within results screen)
     - [x] Display 5 variants with tone badges and length validation (‚â§900 chars)
     - [x] Each variant provides Copy and Share actions
   - [x] Mirror existing error handling and retry behavior
   - [x] Respect mock mode flag for development

4. Spacing and visual polish ‚úÖ COMPLETED
   - [x] Consistent horizontal padding, vertical spacing between sections, and readable typography
   - [x] Ensure layout adapts well to different Dynamic Type sizes

**Acceptance Criteria** ‚úÖ COMPLETED

- [x] No timestamp text (e.g., "Captured just now") is visible anywhere in the results UI
- [x] The extracted text area is editable, occupies most of the screen height, and is easily scrollable
- [x] Only two primary actions are visible post-extraction: "Copy" and "Generate Posts"
- [x] Copy button copies the edited text, shows a transient "Copied" state, and provides haptic feedback
- [x] Generating posts uses the edited text, does not navigate to a Composer screen, and results are shown within the results context (sheet/inline)
- [x] Proper spacing/margins are applied; UI looks balanced on modern iPhones
