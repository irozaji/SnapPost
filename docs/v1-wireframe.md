## PostPro v1 â€” UX/UI Wireframes

### App map (v1, updated)

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  Launch[App Launch] --> Home[Home]
  Home -- Scan Text (Camera) --> Processing[Processing]
  Home -- Choose from Library --> Processing
  Processing --> Results[Results]
  Results -- Generate Posts --> VariantsSheet[Generated Posts (Sheet)]
  VariantsSheet -- Dismiss --> Results
  Results -- Home --> Home
  Results -- Scan New --> Processing
  Home -- History (planned) --> History[HistoryView]
```

Notes:

- Implemented: `Home`, `Processing`, `Results`, `VariantsSheet`.
- Removed: `ComposerView` (functionality integrated inline in `Results`).
- Planned: `HistoryView`, Quick Entry (App Intent + Lock Screen widget).

### 1) Home (HomeView, updated)

States: initial (no text).

```text
NAV: (inline)   [ ]

Content
  Hero section with app icon and description
  Feature highlights (Instant Capture, AI Generation, Quick Share)

Bottom Action Bar (pinned to safe area)
  [ camera.viewfinder  Scan Text ]   (Primary, filled, full-width)
  [ photo.on.rectangle  Choose from Library ]  (Secondary, outline, full-width)
```

Key interactions:

- Scan Text â†’ opens Camera directly (system camera); on confirm processes image.
- Choose from Library â†’ opens PHPicker; on choose processes image.

---

### 2) Processing (ProcessingView, updated)

```text
Processing state with smooth loading UI
  [ Animated processing icon with scaling animation ]
  [ "Processing Image" title ]
  [ "Extracting text with OCR..." subtitle ]
  [ Progress indicator ]
```

Flow:

- Automatically processes selected image with `ImageProcessor.process(image:)`
- Shows smooth animations and progress indicators
- Transitions to Results on success or shows error on failure

---

### 3) Results (ContentView with ExtractedTextView, updated)

Sub-states: Editing, Generating, Error.

```text
NAV: Results (inline)   [Home] [Scan New] [Done when editing]

Content
  Editable extracted text (full-height TextEditor with focus management)

Bottom Action Bar (pinned)
  [ sparkles  Generate Posts ]   (Primary, filled, full-width)

Navigation Options
  Home button (returns to start)
  Scan New (preserves current state for comparison)
```

Flow:

- Generate â†’ `AIClient.generateVariants(...)` (mock or real)
- Text editing happens inline with focus management
- Clear navigation paths always available

Notes:

- Variant length label turns red if >900.
- On share complete, basic history log currently uses `UserDefaults` (v1 placeholder).

---

### 4) Generated Posts (VariantsView Sheet, updated)

```text
Bottom sheet (medium â†’ large)
  [title] Generated Posts   [Done]
  Scrollable variants (5 cards):
    [tone badge]   {len}/900
    {text}
    [ Copy ]  [ Share ]
```

Each variant card includes:

- Tone badge with color coding
- Character count display
- Copy button with haptic feedback
- Share button using UIActivityViewController

---

### Primary flows

Capture â†’ Process â†’ Edit â†’ Generate â†’ Share

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant U as User
  participant H as Home
  participant P as Processing
  participant R as Results
  participant A as AIClient
  participant V as VariantsView

  U->>H: Tap Scan Text
  H->>P: Present processing
  U->>P: Image processing
  P-->>R: ExcerptCapture result
  U->>R: Edit text (optional)
  U->>R: Tap Generate Posts
  R->>A: generateVariants(...)
  A-->>R: [Variant] (5)
  R->>V: Present variants sheet
  U->>V: Tap Share
  V->>U: Present share sheet
  U->>V: Dismiss sheet
  V-->>R: Return to results
  R->>H: Return to home (optional)
```

### Design system snapshot (v1 minimal)

- Colors: system colors (Blue for primary CTAs, systemGray6 for cards)
- Typography: system fonts (LargeTitle, Title2, Headline, Subheadline, Body, Caption)
- Shapes: 12â€“16pt corner radius on cards and buttons; subtle shadow on cards
- Icons: SF Symbols as referenced in screens
- Animations: smooth transitions with .easeInOut timing
- Focus Management: proper keyboard handling and focus states
